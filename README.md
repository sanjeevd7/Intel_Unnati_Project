# Intel_Unnati_Project
This project is a network traffic analysis tool that classifies network packets as **benign** or **malicious** using machine learning.  
It was developed as part of the **IntelÂ® Unnati Industrial Training Program**.

You can view the deployed app on:

## Features

- Detects and classifies network packets in real time.
- Uses a trained **Random Forest** model on the NSL-KDD dataset.
- Supports single and bulk predictions via a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface.
- Clean, modular architecture with reproducible training pipeline.
